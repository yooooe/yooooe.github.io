      <description>idea developed talking in a discord last night: indie game tendancy towards &amp;lsquo;retro&amp;rsquo; perhaps much more complex than simply an appearence of the same in music; whereas in music, lofi etc is increasingly less about the actual methodology and more about layered affect (artificial tape hiss), in games it more often can come from an actual methodology&amp;ndash; an aesthetics of the difficulty game creation poses to small developers. within music we can feasibly reach &amp;lsquo;modernity&amp;rsquo; as such&amp;ndash; it isn&amp;rsquo;t hard to pirate a high end vst, and grab a deconstructed club sample pack off splice and suddenley make something that comfortably fits alongside the cutting edge, when making a game similar attempts generally result in the asset flip catagory, ie a grasp and failure at the affect of modern gameform.</description>

      <description>finished dragon quest 1 nes this morning over coffee, has me thinking about emptiness and vgames. partially i think spurred on from listening to a kenya hara talk on emptyness in design ( ongoing coda in my still generally hostile attitude to &amp;lsquo;design&amp;rsquo; )&amp;ndash; something about it seems apt when thinking about games, especially a game like dragon quest 1. from the perspective of the present especially, dq1 has an overall texture of being hollowed out from the inside, lacking some kind of connective fluid between each of it&amp;rsquo;s parts, despite extremely similar games not having this issue through virtue of being more &amp;lsquo;fleshed out&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>protagonist in a game less as a distinct entity and more as a propulsion of atoms /mass centred on a coordinate you slide greasily around smooth collision planes and box gardens. strange and maybe problematic to notice how vgames (as experienced when playing, not when making !) inherently create a cohesion to whatever they contain, an automatic assumption of sense and logic , maybe formed through their nature as being on the computer.</description>

      <description>mass as a rhetoric strategy. somehow utilising the overwhelming on a sensoral level to do something? one problem of the present is the total asailling of the senses the personal computer has on us. vgames seem interesting to me pretty much because they feel like a device which can, even if to goofy / questionable ends, actually funnel desire on the computer, perhaps into somewhere that has a potential to be somewhat textually potent.</description>
