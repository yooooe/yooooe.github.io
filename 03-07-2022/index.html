        <p>mass as a rhetoric strategy. somehow utilising the overwhelming on a sensoral level to do something? one problem of the present is the total asailling of the senses the personal computer has on us. vgames seem interesting to me pretty much because they feel like a device which can, even if to goofy / questionable ends, <em>actually</em> funnel desire on the computer, perhaps into somewhere that has a potential to be somewhat textually potent. most games are not even are aware of this whatsoever, the general consumer product Game does do this but to what end&ndash; the casinos in vegas etc have nothing on gacha: glowing fruit has such little purchase on the psyche compared to the empathetic vacuums of contemporary character design.</p>
<hr>
<p>finnegans wake, dragon quest 7, magic wand all function on this drive to use the meandering and listless and overhwelming (massive?) as a kind of strategy. the videogame as &rsquo;the mass of literature&rsquo;, as a kind of attack on the psyche, but one that reveals itself slowly/ portractedly? main downfall of a lot of attempts for change tend to be ones of lack of patience, vgames have a tendancy towards making this much worse maybe. though, equally i feel they have an abillity to go the opposite way? i think a key imposition on the game form rn is the introduction of the idea that they could be &lsquo;productive&rsquo;&ndash; it&rsquo;s imperitive that games retain their status as time wasting, time dilation, etc. games are in a bad state as it stands as play to earn formats enroach on all fronts, though this is simply the standard next step from neoliberalism to turn all forms of non-work or leisure into potential spaces for work or productivity.</p>
<p>games are primed for this in the sense they are awful at linearity despite the common perception. every videogame is nonlinear in that at any point you can walk away from it and it will gormlessly stare outwards from the screen until you pick up the controller or it somehow turns off. kind of as if the &lsquo;medium of film&rsquo; encopassed the tv remote, this abillity to pause and unpause built into the very stuff of it. common idea really that games dont really flourish in attempts at the style of writing they often go for now, netlfix style serialised tv dialogue and gestures at &rsquo;emotion&rsquo; thru &lsquo;poignent scenes&rsquo; and &lsquo;brutal deaths&rsquo; etc. the generalised awkwardness of games disperses the wrought melodramatic potency , we&rsquo;re invited by the game designers and such to ignore the goofy framing devices , strange pauses lent by lazy presses of the A button, and so on, and to reconstruct this ideal vision of the game as delivery mechanism. games work best as non linear literature devices, something thecatamites has more than gestured at in essays and games&ndash; the dragon quest games are a classic example, the way the game has no way to assume which npc you will talk to first in the town you just entered, giving each a kind of unplaceable meandering cadence. every textbox is a perfect mix between hostillity, clues, affabillity, and the odd joke. abit gauche perhaps to invoke , but is very much a rhizomatic sensability taken towards writting; even better than any book could hope to achieve. this totally horizontal arrangement, where there arent clear entries and exits, so everything must become an entry and exit itself, just in case.</p>
<hr>
<p>vgames often critiqued on assumption that the actions they enact on player/ train player to do / enforce to proceed are to be seen as analagous to a real-world action, as in jumping is a kind of benign activity as it would be irl, monetary exchange is capitalism, shooting a gun is shooting a real gun etc. understandable why this is a common methodology though it feels more like something adopted from another history of critique plastered onto games because we still haven&rsquo;t figured out how we should approach them as critical objects. i think this is notable not just in the way it has shaped games writing in the popular sense, but also in how it has and continues to shape how games are made. eg, you can identify strands within indie games/ small games communities which would emphasise a lack of monetary transactions in a game as being anti-capitalist, or the lack of combat as anti-violence, and so on. i think this makes sense of a cursory appraisal but doesnt really stand up beyond that&ndash; a cultural framing trend of videogames as &lsquo;origins&rsquo; of behaviours/ affects, rather than symptoms of a wider culture (ie violence in games as a cause of violence rather than a symptom of a violent society). i think this is where we can locate the imo benign trend of &lsquo;wholesome games&rsquo; which seem to be the result of a whittling down of these elements, a creativity thru reduction/ negation. i think in a lot of ways this is aligned with a similar sensabillity in contemporary art where non-positional stances or neutrallity is used as a way to ensure buisiness as usual. what i mean by this is, you could very easily follow this creative path with a game, thinking you are making a work which stands against ie violence and capitalism through the extraction of them from the game, but in actuallity end up to what amounts to mario with a different aesthetic veneer&ndash; like saying mario would be anticapitalist if we removed the coins etc. perhaps this is particularly pervasive within games due to afformentioned cultural memetic that vgames function as endorsements of what they contain in some way, that their primary mode of meaning is as retraining the psyche moreso than something to engage with knowingly. this is fuzzy territory becuase clearly there are games which do latch onto the worst intersections of capital and the psyche ( any number of tired examples of predatory gambling practices, loot boxes, gacha )&ndash; though again these are less instigators and more amoung a milleu of similarly depraved cultural practices. in other words i guess im saying that despite the sheer ubiquity and destructiveness of these practices, they aren&rsquo;t the root of these problems, and simply not engaging with capitalism within an art context has a strong history of having no effect whatsoever.</p>
