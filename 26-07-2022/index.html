        <p>saying we need to focus on &lsquo;gameplay&rsquo; as the crux of a needed avant garde in games is perhaps itself also a layover of a past medium? altgame stuff is often critiqued in the sense that it does very little with the &lsquo;medium of games&rsquo; and are generally more concerned with being animation or cinema or paintings etc, but perhaps we can add &lsquo;gameplay&rsquo; to that pile, with the historical precedent being non digital games themselves, that vgames at their core arent gameplay , but simply &lsquo;interfaces&rsquo;, and that gameplay or maybe a better term for it would be rules perhaps, is just an aspect of it that has proposed itself as the centre? i think about this precisely because &lsquo;art content delivery games&rsquo; that have borrowed forms as &lsquo;gameplay&rsquo; often still work as games, precisely becuase the &lsquo;core of the medium&rsquo; is not gameplay, which is perhaps a false idol in a lot of ways, and is rather their quality as interfaces and more &lsquo;purely&rsquo; their propulsive libidinal atmosphere? a game with rules based gameplay vs game with no rules based gameplay isnt the deciding factor being gamic avant garde vs non gamic / visual avant garde? they both remain in the circle of games, both equally &lsquo;gamic&rsquo;?</p>
