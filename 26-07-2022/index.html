        <p>saying we need to focus on &lsquo;gameplay&rsquo; as the crux of a needed avant garde in games is perhaps itself also a layover of a past medium? altgame stuff is often critiqued in the sense that it does very little with the &lsquo;medium of games&rsquo; and are generally more concerned with being animation or cinema or paintings etc, but perhaps we can add &lsquo;gameplay&rsquo; to that pile, with the historical precedent being non digital games themselves, that vgames at their core arent gameplay , but simply &lsquo;interfaces&rsquo;, and that gameplay or maybe a better term for it would be rules perhaps, is just an aspect of it that has proposed itself as the centre? i think about this precisely because &lsquo;art content delivery games&rsquo; that have borrowed forms as &lsquo;gameplay&rsquo; often still work as games, precisely becuase the &lsquo;core of the medium&rsquo; is not gameplay, which is perhaps a false idol in a lot of ways, and is rather their quality as interfaces and more &lsquo;purely&rsquo; their propulsive libidinal atmosphere? a game with rules based gameplay vs game with no rules based gameplay isnt the deciding factor being gamic avant garde vs non gamic / visual avant garde? they both remain in the circle of games, both equally &lsquo;gamic&rsquo;?</p>

<p>noise music often positioned as apex of radical aesthetics and I can feel why that is, but somehow still seems to flounder or be too happy rolling around in it&rsquo;s own shit. in the same way a lot of academic writers position themselves and their ideas as radical, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a particularly interesting or useful statement, as radical things can often easily fall to the wayside. noise music is a &lsquo;pure outside&rsquo; or so outside to the point it ceases interfacing with the inside, which is for me where a lot of art, music, and ideas die. not in a poptimist way but in a way that acknlowedges the need for stuff like Fisher&rsquo;s &lsquo;popular modernism&rsquo;&ndash; that really what instigates sea changes is in the post- movements which utilise the broken glass left on the floor by the &rsquo;true radicals&rsquo; to create something that shifts perceptions tangibly. noise music, and perhaps a vgame parrallel being certain strands of altgames a la pure indecipherabillity, &rsquo;the experimental genre work&rsquo; etc), often simply just define too well a new standard away from our current states, and just create new conformities; how well does a noise record or a field recording upset any sort of standard in current year? perhaps the only shock is that somehow people still present merzbow infatuation copies as the cutting edge&ndash; can imagine even my own position here being a justification (&ldquo;look it pisses people off!&rdquo;). im not pissed but it is sad to see experimentalism become further aesthetically codified, and even further sectioned off from where a popular modernism could emerge. a kind of neo-revolutionary attitude to art perhaps that we shouldn&rsquo;t attempt to approach anything that could compromise the purity of experimentation. would reiterate again this isn&rsquo;t advocating poptimism, as i think as has been proven in the comedown of pc music etc, that we end up just reifying bland trends (see: the persistence of 80s/90s/y2k wank in current pop still being portrayed as somehow interesting or new or anything beyond laziness).</p>
