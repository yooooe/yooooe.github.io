      <description>finished dragon quest 1 nes this morning over coffee, has me thinking about emptiness and vgames. partially i think spurred on from listening to a kenya hara talk on emptyness in design ( ongoing coda in my still generally hostile attitude to &amp;lsquo;design&amp;rsquo; )&amp;ndash; something about it seems apt when thinking about games, especially a game like dragon quest 1. from the perspective of the present especially, dq1 has an overall texture of being hollowed out from the inside, lacking some kind of connective fluid between each of it&amp;rsquo;s parts, despite extremely similar games not having this issue through virtue of being more &amp;lsquo;fleshed out&amp;rsquo;.</description>
