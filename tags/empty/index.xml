      <description>idea developed talking in a discord last night: indie game tendancy towards &amp;lsquo;retro&amp;rsquo; perhaps much more complex than simply an appearence of the same in music; whereas in music, lofi etc is increasingly less about the actual methodology and more about layered affect (artificial tape hiss), in games it more often can come from an actual methodology&amp;ndash; an aesthetics of the difficulty game creation poses to small developers. within music we can feasibly reach &amp;lsquo;modernity&amp;rsquo; as such&amp;ndash; it isn&amp;rsquo;t hard to pirate a high end vst, and grab a deconstructed club sample pack off splice and suddenley make something that comfortably fits alongside the cutting edge, when making a game similar attempts generally result in the asset flip catagory, ie a grasp and failure at the affect of modern gameform.</description>

      <description>finished dragon quest 1 nes this morning over coffee, has me thinking about emptiness and vgames. partially i think spurred on from listening to a kenya hara talk on emptyness in design ( ongoing coda in my still generally hostile attitude to &amp;lsquo;design&amp;rsquo; )&amp;ndash; something about it seems apt when thinking about games, especially a game like dragon quest 1. from the perspective of the present especially, dq1 has an overall texture of being hollowed out from the inside, lacking some kind of connective fluid between each of it&amp;rsquo;s parts, despite extremely similar games not having this issue through virtue of being more &amp;lsquo;fleshed out&amp;rsquo;.</description>
