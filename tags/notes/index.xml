      <description>game design as such increasingly feeling like a kind of buyer&amp;rsquo;s remorse, a retroactive justification mutated into industry standard so we can collectively rid of ourselves the guilt felt after spending 6 hours stationary and grinding away in some amoral polygonal cavern. game design standards are less a rigourous logic and more a fuzzy layer of abstraction that gives us insight into what the human organism enjoys most when engaging with the computer, attempting a mathematical mapping of certain values to this being more a divination than academics.</description>

      <description>finished dragon quest 1 nes this morning over coffee, has me thinking about emptiness and vgames. partially i think spurred on from listening to a kenya hara talk on emptyness in design ( ongoing coda in my still generally hostile attitude to &amp;lsquo;design&amp;rsquo; )&amp;ndash; something about it seems apt when thinking about games, especially a game like dragon quest 1. from the perspective of the present especially, dq1 has an overall texture of being hollowed out from the inside, lacking some kind of connective fluid between each of it&amp;rsquo;s parts, despite extremely similar games not having this issue through virtue of being more &amp;lsquo;fleshed out&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>protagonist in a game less as a distinct entity and more as a propulsion of atoms /mass centred on a coordinate you slide greasily around smooth collision planes and box gardens. strange and maybe problematic to notice how vgames (as experienced when playing, not when making !) inherently create a cohesion to whatever they contain, an automatic assumption of sense and logic , maybe formed through their nature as being on the computer.</description>

      <description>mass as a rhetoric strategy. somehow utilising the overwhelming on a sensoral level to do something? one problem of the present is the total asailling of the senses the personal computer has on us. vgames seem interesting to me pretty much because they feel like a device which can, even if to goofy / questionable ends, actually funnel desire on the computer, perhaps into somewhere that has a potential to be somewhat textually potent.</description>
