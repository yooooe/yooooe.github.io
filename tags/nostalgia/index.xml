      <description>idea developed talking in a discord last night: indie game tendancy towards &amp;lsquo;retro&amp;rsquo; perhaps much more complex than simply an appearence of the same in music; whereas in music, lofi etc is increasingly less about the actual methodology and more about layered affect (artificial tape hiss), in games it more often can come from an actual methodology&amp;ndash; an aesthetics of the difficulty game creation poses to small developers. within music we can feasibly reach &amp;lsquo;modernity&amp;rsquo; as such&amp;ndash; it isn&amp;rsquo;t hard to pirate a high end vst, and grab a deconstructed club sample pack off splice and suddenley make something that comfortably fits alongside the cutting edge, when making a game similar attempts generally result in the asset flip catagory, ie a grasp and failure at the affect of modern gameform.</description>
