        <p>finished dragon quest 1 nes this morning over coffee, has me thinking about emptiness and vgames. partially i think spurred on from listening to a kenya hara talk on emptyness in design ( ongoing coda in my still generally hostile attitude to &lsquo;design&rsquo; )&ndash; something about it seems apt when thinking about games, especially a game like dragon quest 1. from the perspective of the present especially, dq1 has an overall texture of being hollowed out from the inside, lacking some kind of connective fluid between each of it&rsquo;s parts, despite extremely similar games not having this issue through virtue of being more &lsquo;fleshed out&rsquo;. have more recently come around to thinking this quality of the hollowed-out vgame is the more attractive offering, that as games become less empty, they lose a quality that is compelling to me.</p>
<p><img src="/img/dq.png" alt="dragon quest nes"></p>
<p>that a videogame as a meaningful thing lies in some unknown coordinate between it&rsquo;s constituent parts seems more likely than a very cut and dry methodology ( proceduralism/ school of jblow )&ndash; as in, framing of games less like allegorical teaching devices and more as implaceable vacuum, voids of the irrational that sleep beneath this layer of percieved logic and sense. under this framework a game like dq1 ceases being &lsquo;menu simulator&rsquo; etc and reveals itself really as something much more potent and harder to grasp; this collision of the routine, the imposition of rigid structures , and the psyche. emptiness strikes me as something to consider here: where we can think of vgames as really being the creation of a vacuum, of sorts. depictions of the untraceable&ndash; &ldquo;detail, absorbtion, and slow engagement&rdquo;.</p>
<p>emptiness also in the sense that a game can give almost no indication of the actual intended &lsquo;affect&rsquo; it is meant to have on the player, just this imposition of formatting/ tunnelling drives into a solid. most games offer no attempt at conveying meaning, and generally the ones which try to prescribe a specific meaning tend to be overly fussy , akin to a painter standing by their painting at all times , waiting to chime in and discuss their thinking and rationale etc etc ( like this blog hah ). i think this in effect is an articulation of the issues a lot of people have with artgames, not in the sense they are earnestly hostile to the ideas those games might be trying to convey to them ( which are often incredibly banal non-specific statements /somewhat new age ish, non-commital ) and more a hostility to the sense you get of an overbearing creator that won&rsquo;t leave you or more importantly, the work alone. the avg vgame player appreciates this lack of intention or meaning, this vaccuum space that steers their libido. dq1 feels compelling to me in that it makes no presumption of being meaningful, and in that aquires it&rsquo;s meaning. i don&rsquo;t mean this, either, as an &lsquo;anti profound&rsquo; statement or as anti-art sentiment; games that try to be affective often end up doing so by way of mimicry rather than any consideration of their own qualities&ndash; case in point the range of HBO special / netflix drama style games that get touted as emotional monoliths or groundbreaking examples of the medium. the most interesting games in this regard are the ones which dig deeper into the strange valleys of their own bodies, rather than building scaffolding over them and hoping / telling us not to look down ( which upon doing so we would see a group of skeletons grinding head on against a cave wall , unaware )</p>
