        <p>mass as a rhetoric strategy. somehow utilising the overwhelming on a sensoral level to do something? one problem of the present is the total asailling of the senses the personal computer has on us. vgames seem interesting to me pretty much because they feel like a device which can, even if to goofy / questionable ends, <em>actually</em> funnel desire on the computer, perhaps into somewhere that has a potential to be somewhat textually potent. most games are not even are aware of this whatsoever, the general consumer product Game does do this but to what end&ndash; the casinos in vegas etc have nothing on gacha: glowing fruit has such little purchase on the psyche compared to the empathetic vacuums of contemporary character design.</p>
<hr>
<p>finnegans wake, dragon quest 7, magic wand all function on this drive to use the meandering and listless and overhwelming (massive?) as a kind of strategy. the videogame as &rsquo;the mass of literature&rsquo;, as a kind of attack on the psyche, but one that reveals itself slowly/ portractedly? main downfall of a lot of attempts for change tend to be ones of lack of patience, vgames have a tendancy towards making this much worse maybe. though, equally i feel they have an abillity to go the opposite way? i think a key imposition on the game form rn is the introduction of the idea that they could be &lsquo;productive&rsquo;&ndash; it&rsquo;s imperitive that games retain their status as time wasting, time dilation, etc. games are in a bad state as it stands as play to earn formats enroach on all fronts, though this is simply the standard next step from neoliberalism to turn all forms of non-work or leisure into potential spaces for work or productivity.</p>
<p>games are primed for this in the sense they are awful at linearity despite the common perception. every videogame is nonlinear in that at any point you can walk away from it and it will gormlessly stare outwards from the screen until you pick up the controller or it somehow turns off. kind of as if the &lsquo;medium of film&rsquo; encopassed the tv remote, this abillity to pause and unpause built into the very stuff of it. common idea really that games dont really flourish in attempts at the style of writing they often go for now, netlfix style serialised tv dialogue and gestures at &rsquo;emotion&rsquo; thru &lsquo;poignent scenes&rsquo; and &lsquo;brutal deaths&rsquo; etc. the generalised awkwardness of games disperses the wrought melodramatic potency , we&rsquo;re invited by the game designers and such to ignore the goofy framing devices , strange pauses lent by lazy presses of the A button, and so on, and to reconstruct this ideal vision of the game as delivery mechanism. games work best as non linear literature devices, something thecatamites has more than gestured at in essays and games&ndash; the dragon quest games are a classic example, the way the game has no way to assume which npc you will talk to first in the town you just entered, giving each a kind of unplaceable meandering cadence. every textbox is a perfect mix between hostillity, clues, affabillity, and the odd joke. abit gauche perhaps to invoke , but is very much a rhizomatic sensability taken towards writting; even better than any book could hope to achieve. this totally horizontal arrangement, where there arent clear entries and exits, so everything must become an entry and exit itself, just in case.</p>
