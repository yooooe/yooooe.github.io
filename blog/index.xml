      <description>vgames often critiqued on assumption that the actions they enact on player/ train player to do / enforce to proceed are to be seen as analagous to a real-world action, as in jumping is a kind of benign activity as it would be irl, monetary exchange is capitalism, shooting a gun is shooting a real gun etc. understandable why this is a common methodology though it feels more like something adopted from another history of critique plastered onto games because we still haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out how we should approach them as critical objects.</description>

      <description>mass as a rhetoric strategy. somehow utilising the overwhelming on a sensoral level to do something? one problem of the present is the total asailling of the senses the personal computer has on us. vgames seem interesting to me pretty much because they feel like a device which can, even if to goofy / questionable ends, actually funnel desire on the computer, perhaps into somewhere that has a potential to be somewhat textually potent.</description>
