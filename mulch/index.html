        <p>protagonist in a game less as a distinct entity and more as a propulsion of atoms /mass centred on a coordinate you slide greasily around smooth collision planes and box gardens. strange and maybe problematic to notice how vgames (as experienced when playing, not when making !) inherently create a cohesion to whatever they contain, an automatic assumption of sense and logic , maybe formed through their nature as being on the computer. code is an inherently rationalising force, and vgame making an inherently de-rationalising force ( in coding the perception of &ldquo;correct&rdquo; is through it&rsquo;s function not our drives or desire, making a game is the opposite where the rationale and logic comes after making or identifying that which is &lsquo;correct&rsquo; to our desires /drives ). the logic of game design is mostly overspill from the logic of code/using a computer, a game is an associate daydream that, as easily as it accepts any content, funnels it into a very limited number of formulations for which that content may take up&ndash; sprites, objects, enemy, party member, npc, wall texture. i say problematic as where can vgames actually go with this, or are they stuck with this limited hand to reshuffle etc.</p>
<p><img src="/img/chulip.png" alt="chulip ps2"></p>
<p>vgame making as a de-rationalising drive: i think it&rsquo;s clear that making a game goes against most of our sense of logic and rationality&ndash; games often are less a logic you can follow as you would a line of argument etc and more a series of retroactive assertions to justify &lsquo;why this feels good&rsquo; or why something in the game feels &lsquo;correct&rsquo;&ndash; an affirmation of our drive&rsquo;s plasticity. if videogames have done anything significant it is a demonstration of the plasticity of desire, that desire can be moulded out of anything / the most insignificant rubble. games undermine the idea of natural or innate drives well i think, as theyre far too catagorically distinct from non-electronic games for this to come under the generalised catagory of play. this is a simple extension of the same demonstrated by general computer use, this total rewiring of the psyche/nervous system through prolonged exposure to the computer. this formulation of new drives and desires, ones that had no potential to present themselves up to the recent past.</p>
<p>games work against a rational formulation of desire, the idea that we do indeed have biological drives innately, that they arent formed in reaction to what encases our bodies. capitalism/neolib has seized on this ofc&ndash; contemporary mainstream gaming landscape is almost totally driven to inserting capital into ppls libido through the computer beyond anything else. what keeps me engaged with games perhaps is that they still feel untapped in this sense, that the well isn&rsquo;t yet dry&ndash; and i think this is where we can maintain a position of being against how technology has come to be used rather than the technology itself, which is ceding far too much to capitalism in giving it dominion over the realm of technology and &lsquo;progress&rsquo;, and the future itself. would like to think games still have some potential in being anti-work, in the sense that they stand as a lazy activity, time-wasting/ time-dillation&ndash; that is to stress the importance of how dire it really is the increasing intensity at which capital uses vgames as a host body. which isn&rsquo;t to suggest there has ever been a period of vgames existing outside capitalism, but to suggest this more recent development of moving beyond the simple commodity-form to something more sinister: shopping malls, storefronts, casinos in yr pocket etc. it&rsquo;s important imo to defend this territory of the electronic videogame as a frontier of non-work, of slow time, as a kind of last bastion of mindless wandering&ndash; not as a kind of escapism but a kind of non-production. vgames arent empowered through shakey ideas sold to us about immersion or escapism, but through their quality of allowing us a space for something else to enter&ndash; maybe akin to having a boring day job that allows you space to think about the stuff you really care about. a good vgame perhaps isnt one which proposes interesting ideas itself but allows itself to recede backwards.</p>
