        <p>idea developed talking in a discord last night: indie game tendancy towards &lsquo;retro&rsquo; perhaps much more complex than simply an appearence of the same in music; whereas in music, lofi etc is increasingly less about the actual methodology and more about layered affect (artificial tape hiss), in games it more often can come from an actual methodology&ndash; an aesthetics of the difficulty game creation poses to small developers. within music we can feasibly reach &lsquo;modernity&rsquo; as such&ndash; it isn&rsquo;t hard to pirate a high end vst, and grab a deconstructed club sample pack off splice and suddenley make something that comfortably fits alongside the cutting edge, when making a game similar attempts generally result in the asset flip catagory, ie a grasp and failure at the affect of modern gameform. i say complex in that small vgames have often trended towards an aesthetic lofi&ndash; asides about games which visually and technically resemble psx games but still require high end setups to run are apt&ndash; but in that they can almost never as a medium escape this as a formulation, unlike music. the nature of code as such mandates this, that at every level there is a sense of there being a Beneath, the innate taunt of the digital: that whatever you engage with is at some level an abstraction away from &rsquo;the stuff of it&rsquo;. the digital is inately abstract, inately recombinations of a &lsquo;homogenous substrate&rsquo; (galloway). music in a lot of ways has remained in the digital era as a kind of mimicry of the analog, not simply in an aesthetic sense but in the sense that, despite computers not requiring a &lsquo;recorded music&rsquo; , it is still the most common presentation of digital music, as this frozen output of a single moment. videogames function historically outside this axiom, though in recent times have begun to relinquish the simulated, as in the phasing out of midi soundtracks that played &rsquo;live&rsquo; for pre-recorded tracks. early videogames capture the gestalt of the digital, they have this raw , mathematical coldness in them that resonates the digital outward. a bitmap is an abstraction of bytes etc. even still, digital music files are equally as abstract, as the nature of digitality is to reduce everything to a common substance. gamers know this through the voids that encase every game; the interstitial zone between 0 and 1 etc (half A button press in mario 64).</p>

<p>'empty' feels like a special resonance, then, with vgames-- not only as a subject matter but as a parallel 'clone' of the emptyness between /beneath digitallity. perhaps empty videogames 'speak to' their material conditions on a more interesting level, where the less-empty videogame</p>

<p>this is in part what gives digital work a slipperyness that can be seen as &lsquo;offputting&rsquo; or inhuman, this underlying sense that a digital work is an approximation of an unseen, ghostly aparatus Beneath the screen. the screen is unable to represent what is going on between pixels, it can only deal with abstract catagories and the digital can only approximate curves and interpolate between values. this is the &lsquo;ghost in the machine&rsquo; as such, the void. digitallity is seen as apart from the real world in part through this, that this abstraction goes so aggresively against our intuition of the knowable world. this is why eg someone would accept an abstract painting or sculpture but not a digital work&ndash; an abstract physical painting is only abstract in subject matter, and is non-abstract in that it can never transcend it&rsquo;s own body. an abstract expressionist canvas can never cease being itself, it will always be the wood support, the fibres that make up the fabric stretched over, the pigments and binder that make up the paint, the interlocking of the paint and canvas&hellip; a physical abstraction is only abstract in it&rsquo;s subject matter, not in it&rsquo;s body; it is a simulation of abstraction, whereas only the digital can Be Abstract. the digital is always abstract. this is the site of the primal unease a computer presents, these deeper and deeper levels beyond the visible layer. this is what it means to say &lsquo;gamers love the voids&rsquo; (thecatamites) in that what that is really saying is, gamers subsume this abstraction into the formulation of new drives. perhaps this contributes to digital addiction tendancies? that , through routing drives and desires through the digital , we are left with a void in our desire, where desire is somehow no longer in a smooth curve but alliased, a &lsquo;void of contiguousness&rsquo; as some kind of driver itself&ndash; desire autocorrecting itself as best it can.</p>
