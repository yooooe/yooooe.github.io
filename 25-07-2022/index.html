<p>game design as such increasingly feeling like a kind of buyer&rsquo;s remorse, a retroactive justification mutated into industry standard so we can collectively rid of ourselves the guilt felt after spending 6 hours stationary and grinding away in some amoral polygonal cavern. game design standards are less a rigourous logic and more a fuzzy layer of abstraction that gives us insight into what the human organism enjoys most when engaging with the computer, attempting a mathematical mapping of certain values to this being more a divination than academics. the fuzziness of game design feels apparent to me when i come back to something in a new state, tired etc, and can physically feel the ill tuned attempt i had made earlier. equally changing how fast you move, how high you jump, how intense the gravity is, will come back later still to find those equally innapropriate&ndash; conveys to me directly how strongly game design depends on the physical body, how much it is in response to it.</p>
<p>and where vgame design is then inhereted from the conditions and drives pre-eminent in the body, it then itself imparts on the body new drives and desires, creating a constant oscillation. would say this is potentially how addiction to games happens, &lsquo;game design&rsquo; being a physio-psycho-bio-constructive loop, training the body to live off it&rsquo;s own effluence and sewage.</p>
<hr>
<p>we can&rsquo;t have a game design or logic of games prior to the existence of games themselves&ndash; vgame design and logic/rationale hinges on the unanswered first question of game design: why do they draw us in; mario 1-1 can be &lsquo;good design&rsquo; and &rsquo;teach without saying&rsquo; and so on, but these asume an underlying structure that is satiated by this&ndash; that we should want or require these things in the first place. teaching by design is the golden goose in most game cultures, and i can see why and even agree often, but still it remains fuzzy as to what we are being taught through these mechanisms. previously have touched on this, this murkiness games often have of their intention and meaning. sure, we can call a lot of games entertainment, that it&rsquo;s not that deep etc, in the same way we can make a similar claim in music or film that it is unclear &lsquo;what the meaning is&rsquo;. i think this is where i would maybe align games more with music than with film as is still (still) very common&ndash; not in a way that suggests music or games resist &lsquo;deep reading&rsquo; or to fall into the annoying rhetoric that &lsquo;intellectualising something kills it&rsquo;, but to suggest a synergy between the way music can be said to play off the nervous system, the way bpm is closely tied to the rhythms of the human body.  vgame design is more like an irrationality as it hinges on a fuzzy beginning that is itself modulated by the experience of playing a game.</p>
<hr>
<p>music and vgames: a common internal dialogue conflict i have is whether to commit myself to music or vgames (my need for an idea of commitment on this is it&rsquo;s own issue)&ndash; i guess the main sticking point in this is the &lsquo;purity&rsquo; of both mediums; music is pure while vgames are messy. have mostly gone for years at this point wavering between a convictional vow to either, but recently have come to think maybe it is precisely in the &lsquo;messiness&rsquo; of vgames as a format that draws me to them, over the &lsquo;purity&rsquo; of music. by purity i mean in the feeling of exposed emotion music conveys, like an idea unadulterated, something primal/raw, hitting the nervous system directly. vgames on the other hand feel almost intrinsicaly adulterated, like water that needs to be filtered 10 times in order to be human-safe&ndash; i think really this quality attracts me to them, this innabillity to be whole or &lsquo;pure&rsquo;. games are a perverse medium. perverse in the sense even the games which strive for the greatest purity (thatgamecompany&rsquo;s works, for example) still innevitably buckle at the seams, their outward perfection more a flushed embarresment asking us to look the other way to retain the illusion of seamlessness. i think this is distinct from glorious trainwrecks / itch.io style embrace of &rsquo;the jank&rsquo; (too stylisticly confined), and more an acknowledgement of the materiality of vgames. vector of a parasitic illusion on which i make my bed etcetera&hellip;</p>
<hr>
<p>thought about games as landfills for a while at this point, something about that association of them being a place to offload vs music as a place for a promethean type of thing. the more i learn about the messy foundations and tricks and illusions that make up a vgame the more perverse they appear to me, further and further away from something &lsquo;respectable&rsquo; and into somewhere i feel more comfortable.</p>
<hr>
<p>games are a way of &ldquo;embodying a logic&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>blogging, and designing a blog, feels like staking out a small plot of land. design i still feel strangely about, somewhat ambivalent but admiring it too, and feeling a kind of disgust at engaging with &lsquo;marketting&rsquo; and all that brings, but objects are nicer when they look and feel and function good. approaching games with a designers mindset seems like it wouldn&rsquo;t work very well, you have to make too many concessions and use too many tricks, too much false flooring. vgames often intercepted as a layer that floats above all of it&rsquo;s scaffolding (feel like the increased awareness of game tech brought through the ubiquity of unity etc contributes to this&ndash; this sense of games being less like objects and more like reconfigurations or expressions of a base technology).</p>
